# GA-cube
Project on haskell in which I will try to solve magic cube puzzle by Genetic Algorithm.
At the current time therea are no GA realisation for target task, but implemented 2 tasks solving:
1. Filling with 1 target bit-string with selected length (the simplest task ever)
2. Finding an Eiler path in graph. There are bug, which I'm not solved yet, but it works in some cases.
